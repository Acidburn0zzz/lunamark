- make it possible to insert custom parsers and callbacks
  for them w/o modifying module code?

- better documentation, also on extending

- release, on luaforge, as rock?

- stack overflow on really large input
  is this due to nested lpeg calls?  this
  input yields a stack overflow:

> > > > > > > > hi
