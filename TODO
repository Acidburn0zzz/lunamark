* TODO tests
  adjust tests (or test runner) so that tidy isn't needed, as
  it can hide some errors, particularly in HTML output
* TODO templates
  - have lunamark look for '<name>.<format>' by default, like pandoc,
    first in local directory, then in ~/.lunamark/templates
    name defaults to 'default', format to the output format.
  - add default templates
  - avoid excess newlines?
* TODO escaping in tex more complicated;
  don't escape in code blocks;
  urls
* TODO html reader based on htmlparser.lua, which I can modify?
* TODO latex reader - write peg
* TODO mathml - look at pandoc2?
* TODO extensions

* TODO make parser user-modifiable (as in v1)
* TODO documentation w luadoc

* TODO documentation, including extending writer + parser

Notes on a possible macro system:  Simply add a function
to the writer:

    W.name = function(last,first)
      return first .. writer(space) .. writer.strong(last)
    end

    W.repeat = function(num,x)
      return string.rep(x, tonumber(num))
    end

When lunamark encounters %name{<inlines>}{<inlines>}
or %repeat[7]{Hi there%space}, it simply calls the writer.name function.

Note that writer.space is currently not a function; maybe that should
change for uniformity.  We may want macros with no arguments that
need to be functions: e.g. %currenttime.

Probably we'd need several types of arguments:

* parsed inline lists
* parsed block lists
* raw text

Also we'd have to know whether to parse as a block or an inline.
So perhaps we'd need two different kinds of macros.

* inline macros:

        %name{<inlines>}  -- with inline argument
        %name[raw text]   -- with raw argument

* block macros

        .admonition{<inlines>}{|  -- multiline block
        <blocks>
        |}

        .startsource[|
        multiline raw text - first newline ignored

        |]

These macros are all on the writer side. What about the reader side?
E.g. what if we want a macro

    #include[myfile.txt]

that reads myfile.txt and parses the source as markdown?
This can't happen in the writer.  But there could be a way to
register a reader macro.  This would simply call a match-time
parser function that directly modifies the input string.
