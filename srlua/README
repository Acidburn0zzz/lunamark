This Makefile creates a self-running version of lunamark, which
includes the lua interpreter and the lpeg library, and has no
external library dependencies.

It is derived from the 'srlua' code (http://luaforge.net/projects/srlua/),
which is in the public domain.

The files lpeg.c and lpeg.h are from the 'lpeg' library
(http://luaforge.net/projects/lpeg), which is copyright 2009,
Lua.org and PUC-Rio, released under the MIT license.

The srlua README notes:

The Makefile is targeted at Unix systems. Just edit it to reflect your
installation of Lua. Then run make. This will build srlua and glue, and run
a simple test. For each Lua program that you want to turn into a stand-alone
program, do
	glue srlua prog.lua a.out
	chmod +x a.out
Of course, you can use any name instead of a.out.

For Windows, you need to create srlua.exe and glue.exe first. Then for each
Lua program that you want to turn into a stand-alone program, do
	glue srlua.exe prog.lua prog.exe
Of course, you can use any name instead of prog.exe.
